Welcome to my website! Iâ€™m a full stack web developer from Wisconsin, currently living in Massachusetts with my wife and son.

I work at America's Test Kitchen, where I help build and maintain a portfolio of food and recipe websites including americastestkitchen.com, cookscountry.com, cooksillustrated.com, cooksscience.com, and onlinecookingschool.com. Prior to that, I worked at Geisel Software; a consultancy specializing in Internet of Things & embedded development.

I especially enjoy building responsive, highly interactive front ends with JavaScript/React or Elm, and services/APIs in Elixir or Go. I also have written production code in Ruby, Python and PHP, and always enjoy learning new programming languages.

Outside of programming, I'm passionate about jazz music. I hold a doctorate from the Manhattan School of Music, and used to work as a jazz trumpet player and composer. I don't play professionally any longer but I still hold a deep love for jazz music and listen to a lot of it while I code.

If you'd like to contact me, send an email to  aczerepinski at google's email service, or use any of the social media links on this page. Thanks for visiting!

Adam

      , detail = "Ruby was my first programming language. When I was deciding which language to start with, I was especially drawn to Ruby's elegant syntax and expressive naming conventions. I don't write much Ruby anymore, but my early exposure to the Ruby community informs the way I write code in general. In particular, Ruby exposed me to great books and talks by object oriented gurus like Sandi Metz, Martin Fowler, and Bob Martin."

      , detail = "Elixir is a beautiful functional language. I was first exposed to functional programming through Brian Lonsdorf's \"Mostly Adequate\" JavaScript book and talks, and I chose Elixir to more deeply explore the paradigm. Elixir's pattern matching, macros, and pipes enable really enjoyable ways to write code."

      , detail = "React's declarative approach to UI rendering was a breath of fresh air compared to the direct DOM manipulation that I had been doing previously. I love how quickly the framework gets out of the way, and allows me to get everything done with plain-old JavaScript."

I also love that Go conference speakers and book/blog authors have gotten me more familiar with the lower-level underpinnings of the code I write."

      , detail = "To me, this album is the gold standard for straight-ahead jazz. The band transitions effortlessly between lyrical introductions, intense yet controlled swing choruses, and fiery climaxes. Tony Williams's rare ability to sit out for long stretches of time make the performances feel orchestrated."

      , detail = "John Coltrane's tone on the tenor is one of the most beautiful instrumental sounds I've ever heard. There's a high degree of sincerity and humanity behind every note. I picked this album somewhat arbitrarily, as Live at the Vanguard, A Love Supreme, and so many others are also perfect. Trane's all-consuming dedication to his craft is an inspiration that I draw from frequently."

      , detail = "Messiaen's Turangalila, written in the late 1940s, sounds as modern as almost anything composed today. Few other composers have been able to find their own voice along all of music's axes - melody, harmony, rhythm, orchestration, and form. I've spent a great deal of time studying Messiaen's techniques and trying to emulate them in my own work."

<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm a web developer from Wisconsin, currently living in Massachusetts with my wife and son.</p>
<p>I love writing code, and I'm always learning new languages and frameworks. I've worked with Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Rails, Sinatra, Slim, Codeigniter, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sass, CSS, jQuery... In other words, I'm fluent in the tools needed to bring ideas to life on the web. I'm especially interested in continuing to develop my skills with <a href="http://elixir-lang.org" target="_blank">Elixir</a> & <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, which are the technologies powering this website.</p>
<p>In a former life, I worked as a jazz trumpet player and composer. I have a bachelor's degree from Berklee College of Music and a doctorate from the Manhattan School of Music. I don't play professionally any longer, but I still hold a deep love for jazz music and listen to it all day long while I code.</p>
<p>If you'd like to contact me, send an email to aczerepinski at google's email service, or use any of the social media links at the bottom of the page. Thanks for visiting! -Adam</p>

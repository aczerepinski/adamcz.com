     This website - meaning adamcz.com - is an Elixir/Phoenix application. I built it to give myself a self-hosted blogging platform, and to get my feet wet with the Elixir programming language.

<!-- JAZZ ROBOT -->
<div class="dev-project">
  <div class="dev-project-header">
    <span class="dev-project-title">JAZZ ROBOT</span>
    <span class="dev-project-date">JULY 2015</span>
  </div>
  <div class="dev-project-description">
    <p>
     Jazz Robot is a Ruby/Rails app that facilitates learning to play songs in all 12 musical keys. The app offers a collection of songs that can be filtered by difficulty or composer, and transposed into any desired key (or into raw functional analysis). It also includes a client-side educational game that helps users learn the relationships between keys and chords. I blogged about the song index's filtering UI <%= link "here", to: blog_path(@conn, :index) %>.

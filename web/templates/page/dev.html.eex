<p>Here are some of the personal/side projects I've enjoyed working on:</p>

     This website - meaning adamcz.com, the site you are currently looking at - is an Elixir/Phoenix application. I built it to give myself a nice, bloat-free blogging platform, and to get my feet wet with the Elixir programming language.

     Jazz Robot is a Ruby/Rails app that facilitates learning to play songs in all 12 musical keys. The app offers a collection of songs that can be filtered by difficulty or composer, and transposed into any desired key (or into raw functional analysis). It also includes a client-side educational game that accesses a game data API, storing questions and correct answers in private variables. I blogged about the song index's filtering UI <a href="#">here</a>.
